## Test Execution Steps

## Assumptions

- The login page URL is `https://germanyiscalling.com/login`.
- Valid credentials for testing are:
- Email: `validuser@example.com`
- Password: `validpassword`
- The landing page URL after successful login is `https://germanyiscalling.com/dashboard`.
- Error message text for invalid login is `Invalid username or password.`

## Additional Information

- Additional test cases can be added, such as testing empty fields or handling special characters.
- The tests are designed to run on Chrome but can be modified to support other browsers by changing the WebDriver setup.
- Potential improvements include data-driven testing with different sets of credentials using TestNGâ€™s `@DataProvider`.
